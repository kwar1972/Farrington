                </div>
                <p class="text-justify">My main reasons for starting <span class="g-color-primary">Steiner Greves</span> was this desire I had to create a transparent and open working environment. Working with many people in different companies, all having their flaws and strengths. My idea was to take all the strong points from my experience in my financial background and put them together in the same house. This is what I felt was needed for success, a fully informed and engaging work force to help all our clients in their financial lives whether it is a team based project or a one on one project. There is no job too small when it comes to someone’s finances and I believe it’s a necessity to make myself fully available to all my work force and clients. Having worked with so many families and businesses and more than $1Billion in assets, the most important thing I took with me is that each client whether it be an individual or a banking institute is unique. <span class="g-color-primary">Steiner Greves</span>, was put together with the intention to create a corporate culture that removes the word “corporate” and focus on community, transparency being my number one principle. After many years in financial services, there have been occasions in which corporate profits supersede client service. As a fiduciary,<span class="g-color-primary">Steiner Greves</span> will always maintain a strong commitment that prides itself on putting people before products. We are a private company, and are responsible to our clients, not to shareholder value.</p>
