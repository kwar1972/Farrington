            <p class="text-justify ">Equity investment is when you buy one or more shares in a company and invest directly
              in that business.</p>
            <p class="text-justify ">You buy your equity shares and receive returns in the form of a dividend which the
              company may choose to pay – often annually, however it can be at the company's
              discretion. It's important to note that the value of your equity investment may increase
              or fall depending on the underlying value of the company.Many investors, treat equity
              trading as a large portion of their wealth management strategy and, if you choose to
              increase your wealth across the world, equity trading via a wealth management firm is
              one way of doing this.</p>
